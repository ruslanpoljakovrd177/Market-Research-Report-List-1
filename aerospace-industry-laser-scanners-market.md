<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Industry Laser Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aerospace industry utilizes laser scanners for various applications. Non-contact type laser scanners are commonly used and provide accurate measurements without physical contact with the object being scanned. They use laser beams to capture data and create a 3D model of the object. Contact type laser scanners, on the other hand, require the scanner to physically touch the object to obtain measurements. These scanners are often used in scenarios where the object's surface may be irregular or where non-contact scanning is not feasible. Both types offer unique benefits and are commonly employed in the aerospace industry.</p></p>
