<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Leaf Spring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double End</li><li>Open End</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive leaf spring market consists of two major types: double end and open end. Double-end leaf springs have both ends connected to the vehicle frame, providing stability and load-carrying capacity. They are commonly used in heavy-duty vehicles. On the other hand, open-end leaf springs have one end fixed to the vehicle frame while the other end moves freely. They are widely used in light-duty vehicles as they offer flexibility and better shock absorption. These two market types cater to different vehicle applications based on their respective characteristics and requirements.</p></p>
