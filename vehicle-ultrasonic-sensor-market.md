<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Ultrasonic Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward Sensor</li><li>Reversing Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle ultrasonic sensor market is divided into two main types: forward sensors and reversing sensors. Forward sensors are designed to detect obstacles and provide a warning for the driver when moving forward. These sensors use ultrasonic technology to identify objects in the vehicle's path and help prevent collisions. On the other hand, reversing sensors are used for detecting obstacles while reversing the vehicle. They assist the driver in parking or navigating tight spaces by emitting sound waves that bounce off nearby objects and provide feedback to the driver.</p></p>
