<p><strong>The Agricultural Bactericides Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Foliar Spray</li><li>Soil Treatment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agricultural bactericides are used for controlling and preventing the growth of harmful bacteria in the field. These bactericides can be applied directly to the leaves of plants (foliar spray) or to the soil (soil treatment). Foliar spray application involves spraying the bactericide solution onto the leaves, allowing it to be absorbed and provide protection against bacterial infections. Soil treatment involves incorporating the bactericide into the soil, ensuring its distribution and efficacy in combating soil-borne bacteria. Both methods aim to enhance crop health and productivity by suppressing bacterial diseases.</p></p>
