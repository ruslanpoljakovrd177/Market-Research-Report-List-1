<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass FIber Nonwoven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet-Laid Process</li><li>Dry-Laid Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glass fiber nonwoven market can be categorized into two types of manufacturing processes: wet-laid process and dry-laid process. In the wet-laid process, glass fibers are dispersed in water and then formed into a nonwoven mat through various techniques. This method allows for the production of nonwovens with high strength and uniformity. On the other hand, the dry-laid process involves blending glass fibers with other materials and then mechanically bonding them together without the use of water. This process is known for its flexibility and adaptability in producing nonwoven materials for a wide range of applications.</p></p>
