<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biomass Pyrolysis Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fast Pyrolysis</li><li>Flash Pyrolysis</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biomass Pyrolysis Oil Market Types - Fast Pyrolysis and Flash Pyrolysis are two different methods used for the production of bio-oil from biomass. Fast pyrolysis involves rapidly heating the biomass to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen, resulting in the production of bio-oil, biochar, and syngas. Flash pyrolysis, on the other hand, involves heating biomass for a very short duration at extremely high temperatures, which leads to the rapid decomposition of the biomass and the production of bio-oil. Both methods have their own advantages and applications in the biomass pyrolysis oil market.</p></p>
