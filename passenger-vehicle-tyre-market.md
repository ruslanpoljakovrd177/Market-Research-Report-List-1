<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle tyre market is divided into two main types: radial tyres and bias tyres. Radial tyres are constructed with the plies (layers) of cords running radially across the tyre, which allows for better traction, stability, and fuel efficiency. On the other hand, bias tyres have the plies crisscrossing in a diagonal pattern. These tyres are known for their durability, heat resistance, and ability to carry heavier loads. Both types have their unique advantages and are used in different applications based on the vehicle's needs and performance requirements.</p></p>
