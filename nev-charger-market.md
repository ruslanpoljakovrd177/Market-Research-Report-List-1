<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NEV Charger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Charging Pile</li><li>AC Charging Pile</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The NEV charger market consists of two main types: DC charging pile and AC charging pile. DC charging piles are designed to provide a direct current (DC) charge to electric vehicles, allowing for a fast and efficient charging process. On the other hand, AC charging piles deliver alternating current (AC) charge to electric vehicles, which is more commonly used for at-home or work charging, offering a slower but convenient charging option. Both types cater to the growing demand for charging infrastructure in the NEV market, providing options for different charging needs.</p></p>
