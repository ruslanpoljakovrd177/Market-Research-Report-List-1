<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eccentric Disk Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wafer Type</li><li>Lug Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Eccentric disk valves are a type of valve commonly used in industrial applications. The market for these valves is segmented into two main types: wafer type and lug type. Wafer type valves are designed to fit between two flanges and are suitable for low-pressure applications. On the other hand, lug type valves have threaded holes that allow them to be bolted onto the pipeline, making them suitable for high-pressure applications. Both types provide reliable shut-off capabilities, but their design and installation methods differ, catering to different operational requirements in the market.</p></p>
