<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The De-icing spreader Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trailered</li><li>Mounted</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The de-icing spreader market can be categorized into two types: trailered and mounted. Trailered spreaders are designed to be attached to a trailer, allowing for easy transportation and maneuverability. They are commonly used for larger-scale de-icing applications, such as highways or airports. Mounted spreaders, on the other hand, are directly attached to the back of a vehicle, typically a truck or SUV. They are more suitable for smaller-scale de-icing tasks, like driveways or parking lots. Both types serve the purpose of efficiently spreading de-icing materials to combat icy conditions.</p></p>
