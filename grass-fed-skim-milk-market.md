<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grass-fed Skim Milk Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pasteurized Skim Milk</li><li>Ultra-high Temperature Skim Milk</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Grass-fed skim milk is produced from cows that primarily graze on grass rather than conventional feeds. Pasteurized skim milk undergoes the standard pasteurization process to kill harmful bacteria, ensuring safety and extending shelf life. Ultra-high temperature (UHT) skim milk, on the other hand, is heated to a very high temperature for a short period, eliminating bacteria and allowing longer storage at room temperature. Both types provide a low-fat milk option while offering different benefits in terms of safety, shelf life, and storage convenience.</p></p>
