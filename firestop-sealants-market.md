<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Firestop Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Firestop sealants are used to prevent the spread of fire through openings and joints in buildings. Elastomeric type sealants are typically made of rubber or silicone, providing flexibility and durability. They are commonly used in dynamic joints and where movement is expected. On the other hand, intumescent type sealants contain materials that expand when exposed to heat, creating a thick and insulating layer. These sealants are suitable for static joints and are highly effective in blocking fire and smoke penetration. Both types of sealants play a crucial role in enhancing fire safety measures in construction.</p></p>
