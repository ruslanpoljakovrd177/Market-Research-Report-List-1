<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Vision Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs</li><li>Hydrophilic Acrylic IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Continuous Vision Intraocular Lens (IOL) market consists of two main types: Hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs and Hydrophilic Acrylic IOLs. Hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs are made of a material that repels water, reducing the risk of clouding or opaqueness. They are ideal for patients with a more active lifestyle. On the other hand, Hydrophilic Acrylic IOLs are made of a material that attracts and holds water, providing a natural feel similar to the eye's own lens. They are suitable for patients with dry eyes or those who prefer a softer lens material.</p></p>
