<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilators (In-Home Use) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Level Ventilators</li><li>Bilevel Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Non-invasive positive pressure ventilators used at home can be categorized into two market types: single level ventilators and bilevel ventilators. Single level ventilators provide a fixed level of pressure during both inspiration and expiration, which is suitable for patients with mild respiratory conditions. On the other hand, bilevel ventilators offer different pressures for inhalation and exhalation, making them suitable for patients with more severe respiratory conditions or those who require higher levels of support. These ventilators are designed for home use, allowing patients to receive continuous respiratory assistance in a comfortable environment.</p></p>
