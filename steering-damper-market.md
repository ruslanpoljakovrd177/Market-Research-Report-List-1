<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steering Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Piston Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The steering damper market encompasses two types: rotary type and piston type. The rotary type steering damper operates using a rotary mechanism, applying resistance to the steering system to reduce vibrations and improve stability. On the other hand, the piston type steering damper uses a piston mechanism to control the fluid flow within the system, providing a dampening effect to prevent sudden steering movements. Both types contribute to enhancing driving comfort and safety by reducing steering vibrations and promoting a smoother steering experience.</p></p>
