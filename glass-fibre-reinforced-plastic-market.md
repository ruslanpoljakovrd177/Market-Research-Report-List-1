<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Fibers</li><li>Discontinuous (Short) Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) market includes two main types: Continuous Fibers and Discontinuous (Short) Fibers. Continuous Fibers are long, continuous strands embedded in the plastic matrix, providing high strength and stiffness to the composite material. They offer better performance in terms of load-bearing capability and resistance to fatigue. On the other hand, Discontinuous (Short) Fibers consist of shorter fibers, randomly distributed within the plastic matrix. While they offer cost advantages, their strength and stiffness are lower compared to continuous fibers.</p></p>
