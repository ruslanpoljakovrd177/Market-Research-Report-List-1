<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Center Liquid Cooling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Liquid Cooling System</li><li>Direct Liquid Cooling System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The data center liquid cooling system market is divided into two main types: Indirect Liquid Cooling System and Direct Liquid Cooling System. In an Indirect Liquid Cooling System, the liquid coolant absorbs heat from the components through a heat exchanger, which then dissipates the heat into the ambient air. On the other hand, in a Direct Liquid Cooling System, the liquid coolant directly comes into contact with the components, absorbing the heat and removing it through a liquid-to-liquid heat exchanger. Both systems are designed to maintain optimal temperatures in data centers, ensuring efficient and reliable operations.</p></p>
