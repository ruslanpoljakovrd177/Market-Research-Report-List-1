<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Core</li><li>Multicore</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fire resistant cables are designed to maintain their integrity and functionality in the event of a fire, providing continuous power and data transmission. Single core cables consist of a single conductor insulated by a fire-resistant material, ideal for applications requiring high power transmission. Multicore cables, on the other hand, feature multiple insulated conductors within a single cable, often color-coded for easy identification. They are commonly used in complex electrical systems where different signals or power requirements need to be transmitted simultaneously. Both types of cables ensure safety and reliable performance in fire-prone environments.</p></p>
