<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-shrink Cement Grout Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-packed</li><li>Fluid Packaged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-shrink cement grout is available in two market types: dry-packed and fluid. Dry-packed grout is a powder-based mixture that requires the addition of water to form a thick, mortar-like consistency. It is commonly used for applications where high mechanical strength is required, such as grouting of machine bases and column foundations. Fluid grout, on the other hand, comes in a pre-packaged form that is already mixed to a fluid consistency. It is utilized for applications where easy flow and self-leveling properties are desired, such as underplate grouting and filling narrow gaps and voids.</p></p>
