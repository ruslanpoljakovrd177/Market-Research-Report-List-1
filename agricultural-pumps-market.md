<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal pumps</li><li>Displacement pumps</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agricultural pumps can be classified into two main types: centrifugal pumps and displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps are widely used in agricultural irrigation systems as they are efficient in moving large volumes of water. These pumps work on the principle of centrifugal force to create pressure and propel water. On the other hand, displacement pumps operate by trapping and displacing water, using mechanisms like pistons or diaphragms. Displacement pumps are suitable for applications where a constant flow or pressure is required, such as in small-scale irrigation or spraying systems.</p></p>
