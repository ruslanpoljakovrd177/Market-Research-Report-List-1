<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photovoltaic Noise Barriers（PVNB） Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional</li><li>Bifacial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photovoltaic Noise Barriers (PVNB) are sound barriers integrated with solar panels that generate electricity. Conventional PVNBs have solar panels only on one side, while Bifacial PVNBs have panels on both sides, absorbing sunlight from both directions. Conventional PVNBs are widely used and cost-effective, capturing sunlight facing the noise source. In contrast, Bifacial PVNBs have higher efficiency as they can generate electricity from sunlight reflected onto their rear side. This versatility makes Bifacial PVNBs suitable for various locations, including those with limited direct sunlight.</p></p>
