<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Thermal Barcode Printers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Thermal</li><li>Thermal Transfer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary thermal barcode printers are commonly categorized into two types: direct thermal printers and thermal transfer printers. </p><p>Direct thermal printers use chemically coated paper labels which produce images by applying heat directly to the paper. These printers are cost-effective as they do not require ribbons and are commonly used for short-term applications like shipping labels and receipts.</p><p>On the other hand, thermal transfer printers utilize a ribbon that is melted onto the label substrate using heat. This process ensures durable and long-lasting printouts, making thermal transfer printers suitable for applications like product labeling and asset tracking.</p></p>
