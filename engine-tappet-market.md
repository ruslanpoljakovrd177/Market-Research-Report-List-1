<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engine Tappet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Tappet</li><li>Roller Tappet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The engine tappet market comprises two types: flat tappet and roller tappet. Flat tappets are traditional, commonly used in older engines. They have a flat contact surface that slides along the camshaft. Roller tappets, on the other hand, have a built-in roller that rotates as it slides, reducing friction and wear. Roller tappets offer enhanced engine performance, durability, and reduced maintenance requirements compared to flat tappets. These two market segments cater to different engine types and their specific requirements based on age and performance needs.</p></p>
