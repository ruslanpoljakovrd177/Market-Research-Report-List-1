<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Proximity Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Sensors</li><li>Digital Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive proximity sensor market consists of two types: analog sensors and digital sensors. Analog sensors measure proximity based on the change in an electrical property, such as capacitance or inductance. These sensors provide a continuous output signal proportional to the proximity of an object. On the other hand, digital sensors detect proximity through the interruption of a signal or the reflection of light. They provide discrete output signals, commonly used to indicate the presence or absence of an object. Both types have their own advantages and applications in the automotive industry.</p></p>
