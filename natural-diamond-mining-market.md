<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Diamond Mining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Underground Mining</li><li>Open Pit Mining</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Natural diamond mining involves two main types of mining: underground mining and open pit mining. In underground mining, diamond deposits are accessed by creating tunnels deep underground. This method is suitable for deeper diamond deposits and requires extensive excavation and support systems. On the other hand, open pit mining involves extracting diamond deposits from the surface by removing overburden. This method is used when diamond deposits are closer to the surface and involves large-scale excavation and removal of soil and rock. Both methods have unique advantages and challenges in terms of cost, safety, and environmental impact.</p></p>
