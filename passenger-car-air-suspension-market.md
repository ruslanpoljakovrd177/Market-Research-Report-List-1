<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Car Air Suspension Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronically Controlled Air Suspension</li><li>Non-Electronically Controlled Air Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Passenger car air suspension refers to the use of air springs to provide a smooth and comfortable ride. There are two main types: electronically controlled air suspension and non-electronically controlled air suspension. Electronically controlled air suspension employs sensors and electronic controls to adjust the air pressure in the springs, providing a higher level of customization and automatic adjustments. On the other hand, non-electronically controlled air suspension relies solely on the application of air pressure manually set by the driver, offering less advanced features but still enhancing the vehicle's ride quality.</p></p>
